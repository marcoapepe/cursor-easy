Backend

Let's setup the backend to connect to a PostGres instance

instance: PostgreSQL 15
host: localhost
port: 5432
username: postgres
password: postgres

this database contains one table:

CREATE TABLE T_CONTRIBUINTE (
	ref_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	dat_proce DATE NOT NULL,
	cpf_cnpj VARCHAR(14) NOT NULL,
	cliente VARCHAR(80) NOT NULL,
	email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
	dat_cadastro DATE 
);

adapt the code generate using this table for the CRUD. 

the object (class) in the Python code will be called contribuinte.  

this object contribuinte will be linked to the Postgres table T_CONTRIBUINTE.

Please make the changes in the code for this contribuinte class. 


Please remove class User and all its dependencies that were generated by default. Keep only contribuinte that is the main business object of this project.

I already dropped the table T_CONTRIBUINTE and create a new table with name contribuinte. Please make the changes in the code to replace the references to T_CONTRIBUINTE to new contribuinte table.

python start.py
# or
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

Add a new router (endpoint) contribuinte_by_date.  This method will pull all contribuinte table record for the specific dat_proce that was passed by parameter.

Frontend

Now that our backend is ready to handle CRUD in the contribuinte table, let's focus on the frontend project. 

The frontend project is built in React JS.

The main page should show the project name "Easy Interfaces".

On the main page, we should have the following options where the user can select:
- Contribuinte
- e-Financeira
- DARF

The second and third options will be handled later. If user clicks on these two options, the system should show a page "working in progress..."

For the first option, Conribuinte, the system should show a page that shows the data in contribuinte table. 
There will be a date field where the user can select the date.
This date will be referred to dat_proce of contribuinte table. 
If user select a date, the system has to filter the contribuinte table and pull all records of dat_proce date. 
By default, the page should show any date and no results on screen. 
The screen needs a grid of all columns of contribuinte table.
The respective backend endpoint is 
Add a new router (endpoint) contribuinte_by_date.  This method will pull all contribuinte table record for the specific dat_proce that was passed by parameter.
Show the result on the grid.
That's it.
